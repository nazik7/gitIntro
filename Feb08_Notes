WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(); 
WebDriver firefox=new FireFoxDriver(); 
We are using webdrivermanager to be able to get the chomedriver, geckoDriver and internetExplorer driver etc. 
This is how to setup manually your driver
System.set("webdriver.driver","locationOfYourDriver"); 
Maven
- To be able to manage our dependencies we are using maven build management tool. 
- We need pom.xml file
- We are using markup language. 
- pom(project object model)

TESTNG
@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
NOTE: These annotations will run before/after every test annotation
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass
NOTE: It will run before/after every class 
@BeforeTest
@AfterTest
NOTE: if you are executing multiple classes with multiple test annotations and if you want to navigate, validate, print the message one time before execution your classes, you can use the before/After test annotation. 
@BeforeSuite
@AfterSuite
Note: It will run before/after everyannotation in your xml file.
What is the Advantages of TESTNG? 
- It has a lot of annotations
- It has own html reporting
- We can build framework on top of TestNG
- We can achieve paralel testing using TestNG(Selenium Grid, SouceLabs)
chrome and firefox
10          10 = 20 
4h          4h = 8h 
if you do the paralel testing = 4h 
============================================
@Test - it will run with alphabetical order of method name. 
How I can priority my test annotation?
There is one keyword which is priority we need to use in test annotation as a parameter.
How I can disable the test annotation? 
There is one keyword which is enabled will help us to disable to test annotation. 
if the value of enabled is true, it will run your test cases. If the value of enables is false, it will not run your test cases.
NOTE: There is another parameter is alwaysRun. If the value is true it will run the test annotation always. 
XML file
-- is markup language. 
-- we can create xml file in testng
-- To be able run multiple classes, tests and suites in one click. 
 <class name="AmazonPrice"></class>
            <class name="TestNGPractice.AnnotationPractice"></class>
NOTE: in xml file your class name needs to be location of your java file. The location will start after java folder. 
Suite in xml is the defining all your test suites under one tag.

Create new xml file to be able run the MouseActionPractice class. 
suite
test

In TestNG we have one parameter annotation to be able to give the values from xml file we can use this annotation. 
Where is coming my driver? 
@Test
{
    
    driver.get("url"); 
}
TestClass --> TestBase --> Driver 
TestBase
setUpDriver(){
    driver=Driver.getDriver(); 
}
Parallel Execution Using TestNG
- First You need to have one driver class to setup driver from one place. 
- You need to use parameter annotation
- paralel attribute in xml file
- thread-count attribute in xml file
==========================================
Driver.getDriver("chrome").getTitle; 
Driver.getDriver("chrome").getCurrentUrl;
Driver.getDriver("chrome").navigate().To()
Driver.getDriver("chrome").get("url"); 
Driver.getDriver("chrome").navigate().back/forward/refresh 
where I should store the webelements?
- page class
- I need constructor with PageFactory class to initElement(driver,this); 
- I need to use the @FindBy annotation(coming from the selenium)
- Create the object from page class in test class
- Using the page object call the webelement
Page Object Model
Every page goes to the one class. Inside this class we are storing our webelement using @FindBy annotation.
